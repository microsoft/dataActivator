## Microsoft Fabric Data Activator

Microsoft Fabric and Data Activator are currently in PREVIEW. See the Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

### What is Data Activator?

Data Activator is a no-code tool for automatically taking actions when patterns or conditions are detected in changing data. It monitors data in Power BI reports and Event Hub data streams, for when the data hits certain thresholds or matches other patterns. It then automatically takes appropriate action such as alerting users or kicking off Power Automate workflows.

Data Activator allows customers to build a digital nervous system that acts across all their data, at scale and in a timely manner. Business users can describe business conditions in a no-code experience to launch actions such as Email, Teams notifications, Power Automate flows and call into 3rd party action system. Business users can self-serve their needs and reduce their reliance on internal IT and/or developer teams, either of which is often costly and hinders agility. Customer organizations donâ€™t need a developer team to manage and maintain custom in-house monitoring or alerting solutions.
